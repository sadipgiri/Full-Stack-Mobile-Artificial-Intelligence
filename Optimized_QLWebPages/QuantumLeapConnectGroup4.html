<!-- My thoughts: -->

<!-- Although it works, I happen to see a lot of terrible codes or terrible way of doing things such as:
  We could have different files for CSS and JavaScript rather than conjusting in one file 
  because it will be harder to inspect what part of code is doing what as well as adding other things in future.

  Bad indentation

  Though JS script is readable - it’d be better if we’d combine things together
   and make it more cleaner avoiding the redundant block of codes.

   I also don’t like the way of using API key directly in the link
   because anyone can use that link to create their own things or just use the link for their purposes. That is,  in future when the number of users increases we could not launch the Map since many users will be hitting the Google Map endpoints at the same time.

   The code is readable and it works and everything is fine 
   but if that what we want in the future then I’d go on optimizing it breaking the things in the same time. -->
